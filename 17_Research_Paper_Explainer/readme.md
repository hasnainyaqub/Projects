## 🎯 Project Overview

Understanding research papers can be challenging, especially when switching between beginner and advanced concepts.  
This project solves that problem by allowing users to:

• Select a well known AI research paper  
• Choose an explanation style (Beginner, Technical, Mathematical, Code Oriented, etc)  
• Control the explanation length  
• Instantly generate structured explanations using LLMs  

The focus of this project is not only correctness, but also **usability, UI quality, and real world GenAI application design**.
