# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner to intermediate-level Data Science and Machine Learning projects. The projects are implemented using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and other popular libraries. Each project focuses on solving real-world problems using data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques.
